<p>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. <br>
    They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up <br>
    that same day. Great service.<br>

    <p>Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide <br>
    an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid. <br>
    I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.<br>

    <p>Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. <br>
    They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and garden. I highly recommend <br>
    their service.<br>
